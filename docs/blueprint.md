- Background color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Darker blue-gray (#29353D) to match with the main app. It provides clear contrast for selection/active elements and to subtly highlight key actions.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, throughout the app. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Replicate Aludata's icon style, using simple and flat icons for clear identification of functions.
- Maintain the same hard-corner menu and table layout as the original Aludata software for consistency.
- Avoid excessive animations. Use only subtle transitions for actions, focusing on clear, functional interactions.
